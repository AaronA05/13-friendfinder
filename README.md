# FriendFinder

## FriendFinder is a web application utilizing Express and web APIs to deliver your best friend based on survey responses. 

### The friend finder algorithm takes the difference between a user answers and all other users which have taken the survey and compares the difference between the scores. The previous user with the lowest difference will be considered your "best friend".
